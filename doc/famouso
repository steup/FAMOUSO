%FAMOUSO is a publish/subscribe middleware that readopts the ideas and
concepts of its predecessor COSMIC (<b>CO</b>operating <b>SM</b>art
dev<b>IC</b>es).  Additionally, %FAMOUSO provides means for adaption e.g. to a
specific platform. The middleware offers an event-based communication model
according to the publisher/subscriber concept.
%FAMOUSO is especially designed to allow cooperation between smart
sensors and actuators on different hardware platforms ranging from 8-bit
micro-controllers up to 32-bit PC/Workstations and interaction over a broad
variety of communication media like

<a href="http://awds.berlios.de/">AWDS</a>,
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3170.txt">UDP-MultiCast</a>.
On application level it offers an unique API that is usable from different
programming languages (C/C++, Python, Java) as well as engineering tools (

<a href="http://www.ni.com/labview/">Labview</a>).

Key features of %FAMOUSO are:
	- Publish/Subscribe middleware
	- Uniform addressing of topics
	- No control flow dependancies between Publisher and Subscriber
	- Abstraction of the concrete underlying communiction media
	- Hides heterogeneity
	- Portability
	- Adaptability
	- Configurability
	- Deployment of modern software technologies
