%FAMOUSO is a communication middleware. It provides event-based communication
over different network types, according to the publisher/subscriber paradigm.
In contrast to an address-based communication, an anonymous content-based
communication is used, where events are exchanged between communication
end-points. Publishers as well as subscribers are roles that applications have
during the communication. Related to its characteristic as publisher,
subscriber, or both, applications specify the kind of events they produce or
consume. On that simple scheme, %FAMOUSO provides spontaneous and dynamic
many-to-many communication without any assumptions about synchrony of events.
The communication is always asynchronous, avoiding control flow dependencies
and enabling the autonomy of communication participants.

%FAMOUSO is especially designed to allow seemless cooperation between smart
sensors and actuators on different hardware platforms ranging from 8-bit
micro-controllers up to 32-bit PC/Workstations and interaction over a broad
variety of communication media like

<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3170.txt">UDP-MultiCast</a>.
The core functionality is entirely written in C++, however, on application
level %FAMOUSO offers an unique API that is usable from different programming
languages (C/C++, Python, Java, etc.) as well as engineering tools (
