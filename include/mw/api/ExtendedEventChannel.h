             * \brief Provides meta functionality for adding an attribute
             *  requirement to a given event channel implementation
             *
             * The given event channel is assumed to define its handler type
             *  which itself can define its appropriate attribute provision.
             *  If no provision is defined, an empty provision is used instead
             *  and a warning is issued.
             *
             * The requirement is expected to be an AttributeSet at the moment.
             *  All attributes contained in that set are checked against an
             *  appropriate attribute of the provision determined as described
             *  above.
             *
             * The checking mechanism could fail either because a required
             *  attribute is not defined in the provision or the attribute values
             *  do not fit. By the compileError flag it is configurable whether
             *  a warning or an error is issued by the compiler.
